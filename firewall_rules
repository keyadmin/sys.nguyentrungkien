IPTABLE NAT:
To allow LAN nodes with private IP addresses to communicate with external public networks,
configure the firewall for IP masquerading, which masks requests from LAN nodes with the IP address of the firewall's external device (in this case, eth0): 
+) iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
 POSTROUTING: Accept CHAIN NAT Internal Network to external Network. (Config network local nat to internet)
If you have a server on your internal network that you want make available externally, you can use the -j DNAT target of the PREROUTING chain 
in NAT to specify a destination IP address and port where incoming packets requesting a connection to your internal service can be forwarded. 
For example, if you wanted to forward incoming HTTP requests to your dedicated Apache HTTP Server server system at 172.31.0.23, run the following command:
+) iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 172.31.0.23:80
 PREROUTING:  Accept CHAIN NAT  external to Internal Network (config network external access to IP specific).
